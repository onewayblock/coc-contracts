##### Description
In the `purchase` function of the `HardCurrencyShop` contract, there is a possibility to manipulate `totalTokenAmount` values since `_expectedTokenAmount` and `_slippageTolerance` parameters are not validated. Using techniques like flash loans, one can manipulate the price to maximize the effect, paying less `totalTokenAmount` while gaining more benefit from `_USDAmount`. In essence, the slippage protection is not working as intended.

For resolving this issue, it's recommended to rely on oracle values. In Uniswap V3, each pool has a built-in [oracle](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/oracle).

It needs to be clarified whether `_expectedTokenAmount` and `_slippageTolerance` values are provided by the backend. If so, it would make sense to implement backend signature verification.


### CLASH RESOLVING:

We will use only tokens which have USDC pool pair (like ETH, USDT, own token)
We will block transaction if expected token amount is less than real amount
Added additional checks

### Oxorio's response
```solidity
        if (_paymentToken != UniswapHelper(uniswapHelper).getUSDCAddress()) {
            uint256 referenceTokenAmount = UniswapHelper(uniswapHelper)
                .getTokenAmountForOutput(
                    _paymentToken,
                    UniswapHelper(uniswapHelper).getUSDCAddress(),
                    _USDAmount
                );

            if(_expectedTokenAmount < referenceTokenAmount - ((referenceTokenAmount * 30) / 100)) {
                revert expectedTokenAmountExceedsDeviation();
            }
            if(_expectedTokenAmount > referenceTokenAmount + ((referenceTokenAmount * 30) / 100)) {
                revert expectedTokenAmountExceedsDeviation();
            }

            totalTokenAmount = UniswapHelper(uniswapHelper).getTokenAmount(
                _USDAmount,
                _paymentToken,
                _expectedTokenAmount,
                _slippageTolerance
            );
        }
```
Unfortunately, this solution does not address the issue of manipulation, as you are using the spot price from Uniswap V3 as the `referenceTokenAmount`. Consequently, the pool can be manipulated by frontrunning the transaction. In your case, for the `referenceTokenAmount`, you need to consider the price obtained specifically from the Uniswap V3 poolâ€™s oracle. You can learn more about how Uniswap V3 pool oracles work here: [oracle](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/oracle).

#### [NEW] Unable to reuse function calls with signature in `Verification`
##### Location
File | Location | Line
--- | --- | ---
[HardCurrencyShop.sol](https://github.com/onewayblock/clash-pre-audit-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Verification.sol#L501) | contract `Verification` > function `_verifySignature` | 501

##### Description
In the `Verification` contract, the `_messageHash` becomes invalid after use
```solidity
    function _verifySignature(
        bytes32 _messageHash,
        bytes memory _signature
    ) private returns (bool) {
        if(usedHashes[_messageHash]) {
            revert InvalidMessageHash();
        }

        usedHashes[_messageHash] = true;

        bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(
            _messageHash
        );
        return ethSignedMessageHash.recover(_signature) == backendSigner;
    }
```

but the hash itself doesn't contain unique parameters like a nonce.
This means that functions requiring signature validation can only be called once, as subsequent calls with the same parameters will be rejected.
For example,
 ```solidity
        IVerification(verification).verifySignaturePublic(
            keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), 'withdrawBalances', sender, _referralCode, block.chainid)),
            _signature
        );

        msgHash =  keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), 'withdrawBalances', sender, _referralCode, block.chainid))
```



We recommend adding a nonce field to the messageHash, which would be a sequential transaction number, and implementing `nonces[msg.sender]++` increment in the `_verifySignature` function after verification. This way, the current signature becomes invalid after use, and new signatures will differ by their sequential number.

### CLASH RESOLVING:

For withdraw balance added timestamp field which will be the same as user's request timestamp

In the mentioned locations, even after fixes, the restriction remains that a signed message with the specified parameters can only be verified once.

For example, in the setter functions of the `Verification` contract, this limitation makes it impossible to perform updates KYC and AMLScore more than once.

### CLASH RESOLVING:

Added timestamp field to make each separate request unique. We can't allow to use the same data twice, but we can make it unique for each time

##### Description
In the `recordDeposit` function of the `ReferralShare` contract, tokens are added to the balance without actually being transferred to the contract. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the amount by which the balance can be increased.

If one of the addresses in the whitelist is compromised, it can set the maximum possible balance for "its" referral code for each of the tokens stored in the contract. Subsequently, using this referral code, all tokens held in the contract can be withdrawn.

### CLASH RESOLVING:
Added code fixes
About compromised addresses. For now, we're using OpenZeppelin Defender Relayer for all backend transactions and we don't have access to the private key of this relayer wallet, so it's impossible to compromise it.

##### Description
In the specified locations, once a value is set in `userVerifications`, it cannot be changed. This leads to the following issues:
- For `baseKyc/advancedKyc`, passing a `bool` parameter becomes meaningless, as only `true` can be set. Calling the setter with `false` has no effect other than emitting an event.
- For `baseAMLScore/advancedAMLScore`, the inability to modify values in `userVerifications` means that a user can maintain a good score even if it deteriorates significantly. The protocol will be unable to revoke the user's access to higher limits.
- In all four setters, an event with the name `*Updated` is emitted, even though the value is only set once and cannot be changed.


### CLASH RESOLVING:
Removed check for set status for these fields.
For KYC we will have possibility to revoke verification for specific cases.
For AML will be possible to recheck it and change in the contract

### Oxorio's response:

The checks were removed; however, since a signed message can only be verified once, it is not possible to modify the parameters more than once. For more details, see the response to the issue "Unable to reuse function calls with signature".

In the mentioned locations, the checks ensuring that `_sender` is a contract are redundant:
- They restrict payment execution to addresses that are contracts.
- The condition `address(_sender).code.length == 0` is unnecessary after already checking `_isContract`, as both checks determine the contract's size.

As a result of code modifications, the return value from the `call` function is now checked with `success == true`. This is sufficient to trigger a `revert` if the `_sender` address is a contract that cannot accept Ether:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(_sender).call{value: msg.value - _tokenAmount}("");

if(!success) {
	revert ETHSendFailed();
}
```
